# GeneticsAlgorithmAndHeuristics
An attempt to solve combinatorial optimization problems using Genetic Algorithms

Read me  
1. The code has been developed in python 3.7 
2. Use the TSP.py  file supplied. At the bottom you will find a configuration area (line 532) I have already initialized a configuration.You can find the other configuration at the bottom of TSP.py . 
3. The program also creates plots based on data, already initialzed. 
4. Once you have completed the config at line 532 .Run the code.
